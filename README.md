# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer-using-CNN-
##Motivation
Our motivation for this project was to understand how we could apply artificial neural network to classify (recognize) handwritten digits.The main goal was to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We used MNIST dataset to train our model. Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard spit of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it
